# openloco - The open logic controller

openloco is an open source implementation of IEC 61131-3 languages, STL, IL, FBD, LD


## Make IEC 61131-3 great again

Goals:

* Multiplatform:  Linux, Unix, macOS, Windows
* Implement the full Standard (based on IEC:2003)
* Postscript output of graphic languages
* Compiles into LLVM IR to support as many target plattform as possible
* Bindings for popular languages
* Virutal PLC
    * Virtual Raspberry Pi
    * Virtual Arduino
    * Virtual usual PLC
* Configurations files for various systems to use it with conformance
    * Arduino
    * Raspberry Pi
* Package manager for programs and modules
 
## Current Status
